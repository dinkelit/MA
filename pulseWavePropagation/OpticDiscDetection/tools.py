	       cutoff is the cutoff frequency of the filter 0 - 0.5
	       n      is the order of the filter, the higher n is the sharper

def rayleighmode(data,nbins=50):
	"""
	Computes mode of a vector/matrix of data that is assumed to come from a
	Rayleigh distribution.

	Usage:  rmode = _rayleighmode(data, nbins)

	Arguments:  data  - data assumed to come from a Rayleigh distribution
	            nbins - Optional number of bins to use when forming histogram
	                    of the data to determine the mode.

	Mode is computed by forming a histogram of the data over 50 bins and then
	finding the maximum value in the histogram.  Mean and standard deviation
	can then be calculated from the mode as they are related by fixed
	constants.

	mean = mode * sqrt(pi/2)
	std dev = mode * sqrt((4-pi)/2)
